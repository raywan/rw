This repo contains a collection of libraries that I have found useful for my 
game development and graphics projects. I found myself writting common code 
across all these projects so I decided to clean up and factor out the code into
a single repo which all current (and future) projects can use.

The design of these libraries and choices of which functions to implement 
are influenced by stb, Handmade Hero, and raylib. Although I have taken influence
from these three sources, I have designed and coded my libraries to suit my needs
and my tastes.

## Inspiration

The holy grail of single-file libraries.

The most sane and easy to use game engines I have used.
