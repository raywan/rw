This repo contains a collection of code/utilties/libraries that I have found
or found usefulneed  for my game development and graphics projects. I found myself writing common code
across all these projects so I decided to clean up and factor out the code into
a single repo which all current (and future) projects can use. This repo will also
continue to grow along with me.

The design of these libraries and choices of which functions to implement
are influenced by many great libraries I have seen and used (see
[Inspirations](#inspirations)). Although I have taken influence from these sources,
I have designed and coded my libraries to suit my needs
and my tastes.
